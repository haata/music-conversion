flacDownsampleStream is a script that will downsample a flac stream to an ogg stream (which is normal and easy)

Its nice feature is that it re-encodes the flac tags back into the ogg right into the stream.
I wrote this until I noticed that ampache was doing it properly and my mpd was just old...

But its still useful as an example
